# Clusterings
Clustering algorithms play a crucial role in data analysis and machine learning, enabling us to identify patterns, group similar data points, and gain insights from complex datasets. 
I devised from scratch K-Means, K-Means++, and Bisecting Hierarchical K-Means clustering algorithms, and compared their performance using metricsthe Silhouette Coefficient evaluation metrics.
